Operators handle calls based on your emergency contact procedures, until they confirm messages are received or all contact options are exhausted. When reaching a pager or voicemail, they will leave a contact number or record a message to call the answering service. To reach an operator, call your forwarded office line or assigned Apartment Lines number and press #. If prompted, enter your *STAFF password, which is usually set to 0000#.

* Voicemail accounts have both an administrative password (for checking messages, changing recordings, etc) and a staff password (for your staff members to reach an operator faster). You can change either of these passwords at any time by logging in with your administrative password and following the prompts. If you loose track of your passwords, you can log-in to www.apartmentlines.com, navigate to your account, and click the "Answering Service Instructions" link to print off your instruction sheet. The instruction sheet will contain your passwords.
