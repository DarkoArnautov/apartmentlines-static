### Description of Flat-rate Basic service
The Basic service combines live operators with an advanced voicemail system. To use it, simply forward your office line to a number supplied by Apartment Lines (automatic call-forwarding is available upon request). Once on service, a customized greeting directs callers to leave a voice message for your office, or to press a key that transfers them to a live emergency operator. Live operators dispatch qualified emergency calls to the appropriate personnel. Non-emergency callers leave a voicemail message that can be sent to your email and/or retrieved by phone.

### Optional Add-On Features*
 * **Automatic call forwarding:** *FREE*  
   Your calls forward to the answering service whenever your line is unanswered by the 4th ring or all lines are busy.
 * **Voicemail to e-mail:** *FREE*  
   All voicemail messages sent directly to your e-mail -- multiple addresses supported!
 * **Daily call log:**  
   Live operator call records faxed or emailed daily.
 * **Informational recording:**  
   Callers are given options to hear special recordings, such as leasing and property information.
 * **Spanish menus:**  
   Callers may press a key to hear all greetings and prompts in Spanish. This includes access to Spanish-friendly operators for emergency calls.
 * **Extra voice mailbox:**  
   Callers may leave separate voice messages (for example, a sub-property or a specific individual).
 * **Extra call transfer:**  
   Callers may transfer to an outside line, such as an off-site leasing service or on-call leasing agent.
 * **Extra selectable main greetings:**  
   Add additional, alternate main greetings, which can be selectively enabled (for example, one greeting with summer hours, one with winter hours).

**Apartment Lines also provides All-live service. To learn more, and to receive a flat-rate quote for your property, please speak with an Apartment Lines representative.*
